# GGGUI
### A graphic user interface for managing Gemfire or Geode grids on remote machines using GFSH.

GGGUI - Gemfire/Geode GUI aims to be a tool for easing the maintenance, operation, and development of In Memory Data Grids based on GemFire or Apache Geode.
It connects to a remote system using JSch, then runs any GFSH (GemFire Shell) command, using a friendlier interface than the command line.
It also displays command results on tables for easing the viewing and selecting of data.
